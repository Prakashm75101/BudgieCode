PROJECT:
Coming to my project, my project name is Happysolesfootwear based on North dakota that is united states
It is an e-commerce domain project which focusses on selling the footwear for men, women and kids.
Front end of the application is jquery, angular js.
backend is dotnet
for database we are using sql server
social media sign up is available via google,facebook,twitter..
For inventory management we are using the OPS portal which is the dedicated backend application for our application.

On dashboard page we will be having the home page banner which we can configure in Ops portal.
And then we also have the categories banners such as men and women.
By clicking any one of them, user will be navigated to the corresponding category of shoes.
And below to that we also have the most popular products and the price slashed products.

Going to Product list page-->For each categories shoes related to them will be listed in this page.
User can click any one product and then it will be navigated to the product detail page.
In the product detail page, detailed information of the product will be displayed.
Like color, size, price, weight of the product etc.
From here user can either add the product to the wishlist page or to the cart as per their need.
From the cart user can checkout the product by doing the payment.
Payments we just did some sanity check using the Paypal sandbox, where we will do payment using the dummy stripe cards and check whether it is 
reflected.

Most Recent Developments:
The most recent implementation was the mens rocky boots,women rocky boots, Clearance Section with the offers.
Clearance section we have some offers for the clearance stocks that will be unique based on the project.

Roles and Responsibilities:
I start my day by checking the emails.
After that I check the board for any pending items on my name.
If any pending items, I will work on them.
During the standup which usually occurs at 11 am, I will provide quick update about the on-going work which am doing.
During sprint time I will automate the stories completed in previous sprint based on the test case document
During the regression time, I will execute the automation scripts and then review those reports.
If any failure due to script I will fix them.
If it was due to the application, I will test the bug manually and then log in to the JIRA board.

Production Issue:
We faces some sort issues, when the user navigates to next pages.
And we also faced some performance issues during the clearance sales occuring at Black Friday sales.
To resolve that issue our team has increased the server handling capacity comparitively.

Difficulty faced:
We also have a mobile app for our project which was still under development.
Our manager ask to do a order in web and check whether it is reflecting in the mobile app.
Since our framework supports only one driver at a time.
It was really difficult to handle this.
So after consulting with my leads, I created one more instance and completed this test case.
